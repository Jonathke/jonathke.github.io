      Some of non-work stuff.
      <h2> Limericks </h2>
      Sometimes I try to write limericks. They're not very good.

      <h3> Limericks from the Heart - 1st. Edition </h3>
      (Originally appeared in: Eurocrypt 2022 rump session) <br><br>
      <b> Self Portrait </b><br>
      <i> I asked, and I begged, and I pled: <br>
        "Please accept my paper", I said. <br>
        Zero accepts, <br>
        three hard rejects, <br>
        so I went with poems instead.</i> <br><br>
        <b> Talks with famous cryptographer </b><br>
        <i>"Your work has had such a huge impact.<br>
        It changed my whole life, in fact!"<br>
        She started to glow,<br>
        but little did she know,<br>
        that I had only glanced at the abstract.</i><br><br>
        <b> Impostor Syndrome </b><br>
        <i>This talk had me lost at slide three,<br>
        so I asked an esteemed attendee.<br>
        He tried to explain,<br>
        but it was all in vain,<br>
        'cause he was even more lost than me.</i><br><br>

        <h3> Limericks from the Heart - 2nd. Edition </h3>
        (Originally appeared in: Crypto 2022 rump session) <br><br>
        <b> Forgetfullness </b><br>
        <i>There once was this fella from Norway,<br>
        who lived with a self-locking doorway.<br>
        The shower was good,<br>
        but there he stood,<br>
        half-naked and stuck in the hallway</i><br><br>

        <h3> Limerick-preprints </h3>
        (Originally appeared in: Random tweets)<br><br>
        <b> Deuring for the People </b><br>
        <i>There is this theorem, you see,<br>
        where orders and curves are the key.<br>
        They're easy to relate,<br>
        and share many a' trait,<br>
        e.g. both are incomprehensible to me!</i><br><br>

        <b> Cryptographic Smooth Neighbors </b><br>
        <i>If its SQIsign primes that you seek,<br>
        just use this ten year old technique!<br>
        double a twin square,<br>
        subtract one and its there,<br>
        primes so nice that you shriek! ðŸ˜±</i><br><br>
